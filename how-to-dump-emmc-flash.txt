Samsung PM49H eMMC flash dump:

This is the minimal configuration to read the flash in 1-bit mode (slow):
(4-bit mode should certainly be possible by finding DAT1-DAT3, as not all readers support 1-bit mode.)

TP1603/R1624	CMD

R1625	DAT0

TP1602/R1636	CLK

BD1601	VCCQ	(apply 1.8V)

BD1602	VCC		(apply 3.3V)

NOTE:
Remove resistors R1615-1624,1635-1636 and ferrite beads BD1601-1602
prior to connecting the reader in order to isolate the eMMC from the
circuit to avoid damage due to voltage level incompatibility. The 
CPU operates at 1.8V logic levels while most SD card readers operate
at 3.3V logic levels. Leaving the signal/voltage rails connected may
damage the target.
